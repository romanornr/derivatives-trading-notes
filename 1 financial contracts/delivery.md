Delivery is the process of **transferring the [[underlying]] asset** from one party to another.

This usually happens when a contract is traded on an exchange, and it is determined by the regulations of the exchange and the type of contracts traded.


For example, in [[commodity]] [[futures contract]], delivery typically takes place on the [[expiration date]] of the contract, when the positions are closed out and the settlement price is determined.

The [[underlying]] asset is then delivered to the party who held the long position (bought the contract), and they pay the party who held the short position (sold the contract).

In other types of financial contracts, such as options or swaps, delivery may not take place at all. Instead, these contracts are often settled in cash ([[cash-settled]]), based on the value of the [[underlying]] asset on the delivery date.


It is important to understand the delivery process for any contracts you are trading, as it can have a significant impact on your profit or loss.

If you are holding a long position in a [[commodity]] [[futures contract]] and the price of the [[underlying]] asset declines sharply on the delivery date, you may be required to pay for the entire value of the asset, even though you only contracted to purchase it at a lower price.

### [[options]]

In options trading, delivery refers to the process of transferring the [[underlying]] asset from the seller to the buyer.

This typically happens when a contract is exercised, meaning that the option holder chooses to buy or sell the asset at the agreed-upon price. The delivery date is usually specified in the contract, and it is often the same as the [[expiration date]].

### [[futures contract]]


In futures contracts, delivery refers to the process of transferring the [[underlying]] asset from the seller to the buyer on the agreed-upon delivery date. This date is specified in the contract, and it is typically different from the [[expiration date]].

### hedging

Hedging is a risk management strategy that involves taking offsetting positions in different assets in order to minimize the potential loss from an adverse price move.

An entity that is exposed to currency risk may hedge by buying futures contracts in the currency they are selling and selling [[futures contract]] in the currency they are buying. This way, if the value of the currency they are selling falls, the losses will be offset by the gains from the other contract.



You may wonder, **"How can delivery impact a hedging strategy?"**

If a hedging strategy is not carefully planned, the delivery process can have a major impact on the results.

If a entity buys a [[futures contract]] to hedge against a fall in the price of the [[underlying]] asset, but the price of the asset rises instead, the player will have to take delivery of the asset and may end up paying more than they wanted to.

### Tax implications 
  
The delivery process can also have implications for taxation.

If an entity uses derivatives to hedge against currency risk, the gains or losses from the contracts may be treated as currency gains or losses and subject to different tax rates.

### Accounting 


 Delivery can also have implications for accounting.
 
 If an entity hedges against the risk of changes in the value of inventory, the Hedge Accounting Standards require that the company recognize the hedging instrument and the [[underlying]] asset on their balance sheet.

### How does delivery relate to speculation?

Speculation is a type of trading that involves taking a position in an asset in hopes of making a profit from a future price movement. A speculator may buy or sell assets directly or may use derivatives such as [[options]] or [[futures contract]]

### What is the delivery process for different types of assets?

The delivery process for different types of assets varies depending on the exchange and the type of contract traded. For example, in [[commodity]] futures contracts, delivery typically takes place on the [[expiration date]] of the contract, when the positions are closed out and the settlement price is determined. The [[underlying]] asset is then delivered to the party who held the long position (bought the contract), and they pay the party who held the short position (sold the contract).

In other types of financial contracts, such as [[options]] or swaps, delivery may not take place at all. Instead, these contracts are often [[cash-settled]], based on the value of the underlying asset on the delivery date.

### [[interest rate]]

<br>

Interest rates play a role in the delivery process for some financial contracts, such as a [[bond]].

When a bond is traded the buyer typically pays the seller the interest that has accrued since the last interest payment date. This is known as the clean price, and it is different from the dirty price, which includes the interest that will accrue until the next interest payment date.
