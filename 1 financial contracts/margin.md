**margin** is money that a trader must deposit ([[margin deposit]]) to an exchange when they buy or sell a [[futures contract]].  


This helps to **protect the exchange from losing money** if the trader doesn't follow through on the deal.

Prices can fluctuate wile the position is open, and the exchange will periodically adjust the amount of money that the trader needs to keep in their account to reflect this.
