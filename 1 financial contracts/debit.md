In options trading, a **debit** can **occur** when a trader **buys [[options]]**.

This is because the trader must pay the full value of the option to the broker up front. The value of the option is known as the [[premium]].  


A [[credit]] can occur when a trader sells an option. In this case, the trader receives the [[premium]] from the person buying the option from them.

#### [[futures contract]] trading

In **futures trading** a **debit** can occur when a trader **buys a futures contract**.

This is because the **trader must put down a deposit**, known as [[margin]] or [[margin deposit]], to enter the trade.

A [[credit]] can occur when a trader sells a [[futures contract]]. In this case, the trader receives the [[margin deposit]] from the person buying the contract from them.


* This happens when the **price of the [[futures contract]] goes down**.  

* The buyer is **charged the difference** between the **current price** and the price at which the contract was bought.

A debit is the opposite of a [[credit]].
