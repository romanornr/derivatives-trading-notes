### Settlement procedure
<br>
What actually happens when a contract is traded on an exchange?  


The settlement procedure
* -> **Facilitates** the **transfer of the money and ownership of a contract**.  

* -> This is **determined**  by the **regulations** of the exchange and the <b>type of contracts</b> traded.

<br>

___

<br>

#### [[cash transaction  ]]

Consider a trader 
``buying 100 shares of a $50 stock``


Total value of the stock: ``100 x $50 = $5000``.


* -> The buyer must pay this amount to the seller.  

* -> The exchange acts as an intermediary and transfers it to the seller.  

* -> Simultaneously, the **exchange takes [[delivery]]** of the <b>shares from the seller</b>.  

* -> and <b>transfers</b> these <b>to the buyers.</b>  

<br>

This is basically a [[cash transaction]] with the **exchange making both [[delivery]] and payment**.

An **exchange** is a marketplace where assets are bought and sold. **The transaction is considered a [[cash transaction]]** since the buyer and seller agree on the price.  

<br>

___

<br>

### futures type settlement 

A **futures contract is a forward contract**
* -> there is no immediate exchange of money for goods.  

* ->The buyer pays no money, and the seller receives none.   

* -> By entering into a [[forward contract]], both the buyer and the seller have taken on future [[obligation]]

<br>

___

<br>

#### [[maturity]]

At contract [[maturity]]
* -> the seller is has the [[obligation]] to deliver ([[delivery]])

* -> and the buyer has the [[obligation]] to pay.  


___

<br>

### [[margin]]
 
 The exchange collects a [[margin deposit]] from each party that it holds as security against possible default by the buyer or seller.  

* -> It depends on the [[notional value]] of the contract and the possibility of price fluctuations over the life of the [[futures contract]].  

* -> An exchange will try to set margin requirements high enough so that the exchange is reasonably protected against default but not so high that it inhibits trading.  

<br>

___

<br>

If the price of the [[commodity]] at [[maturity]] is $90, the buyer must pay $90 ×1,000 = $90,000.

* -> A futures trader can close out a position in one of two ways.
* -> Before the [[maturity]] of the [[futures contract]], he can make an offsetting trade, selling out the futures position and buying it back in the same [[delivery]] month.  
* -> Or, on or near the [[maturity]] date, he can take [[delivery]] of the [[commodity]].


If the position moves against the trader, he may be forced to close the position earlier than intended.

* -> [[margin]] is money collected by the exchange to ensure that a trader can fulfill future financial obligations should the market move against him.

* -> Even though deposited with the exchange, margin deposits still belong to the trader and earn interest for the trader.

<br>

___

<br>

### [[variation credit]] / [[variation debit]] & [[variation payment]]

 [[variation credit or debit]] results from fluctuations in the price of a futures contract.
 
 * => A [[variation payment]] can either earn interest if the variation results in a [[credit]].
 * => If the variation results is in a [[debit]] it will lose interest.  

<br>

When a trader buys a [[futures contract]], he is said to have a long position, and when he sells a [[futures contract]], he is said to have a short position.  



If the price of the futures contract falls
* -> the long position loses money, and the short position makes money. 

If the price of the futures contract rises
* -> the long position makes money, and the short position loses money.

<br>

___

<br>

### North American options

All exchange-traded options in North America, whether stock options, stock indexes, [[futures contract]], or foreign currencies, are [[stock-type settlement]].  


* -> In stock option markets, this is both logical and consistent because both the underlying contract and options on that contract are settled using identical procedures.

* -> However, on U.S. futures options markets, the [[underlying]] contract is settled one way ([[futures-type settlement]]), while the options are settled differently ([[stock-type settlement]]).



In North America, the settlement of exchange-traded [[options]] provides an interesting scenario in terms of investor return.

Due to the fact that all options are **settled** similarly to stocks ([[stock-type settlement]])
* => there is no daily [[variation credit]] or [[variation debit]].
* => However, no initial [[margin deposit]] is necessary. Thus, what is the actual return on an investor's option position?

<br>

we must take three factors into account: 
* the price at which the option is purchased or sold.  
* the passage of time.  
* the price of the [[underlying]] contract upon option [[expiration date]].

<br>

 By taking these **three aspects** into account, we can build a broad framework for **assessing an option position** and **determining** how the **price of an option** is **connected** to changes in these three variables.

The return on a trader's **option position** is calculated as the **difference between the price of the option** at the **time it is purchased** and the **price of the option at the time it is sold**. This is true for both purchased and sold options.

* If trader purchases an option and then sells it at a higher price, the trader will profit
* If the investor purchases an option and then sells it for a lower price, the trader will lose money. 
 * Profit or loss will be determined by the difference between the buy and selling prices of the option, as well as the volume of options contracts exchanged.

Additionally, the investor's return will be influenced by the time period between buy and sell, as well as by changes in the underlying contract's price during that time period.

These three variables –
* The option's purchase price
* The elapsed time
* Changes in the [[underlying]] contract's price – all affect the option's price and, subsequently, the option's return.

###  Different settlement  procedures cause [[cash flow]] problems

<br>

 On U.S. [[futures options]], the [[underlying]] contract is settled one way ([[futures-type settlement]]), while the options are settled in a different way ([[stock-type settlement]]).

**Different settlement procedures** can cause **problems** when a trader has bought or sold an **option** to **hedge a futures position**.

* => He can occasionally find himself with ***unexpected [[cash flow]] problems***.

*  A trader might have a futures position that is subject to [[futures-type settlement]] settlement ([[margin]] and [[variation settlement]]) and an offsetting options position that is subject to stock-type settlement ([[cash-settled]].

* => If the market moves against the trader and the trader does not have sufficient funds to cover the [[margin]] requirements, he may be forced to close the position earlier than intended.
