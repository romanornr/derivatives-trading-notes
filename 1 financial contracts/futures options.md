***Futures options markets*** are simply [[options]] markets
* => where the [[underlying]] asset is a [[futures contract]]

<br>

#### [[settlement procedure]]

<br>

The [[settlement procedure]] **facilitates the transfer of the money and ownership of the contract**. This is determined by the regulations of the exchange and the type of contracts traded.


For example, when a futures contract is traded on an exchange, the exchange collects a [[margin deposit]] from each party that it holds as security against possible default by the buyer or seller.


When the contract is traded, both the buyer and the seller have taken on future [[obligation]].
* -> At contract [[maturity]], the seller is obligated to [[delivery]]  
* -> The buyer is obligated to pay.  
* -> The exchange wants to ensure that both parties live up to this [[obligation]].
