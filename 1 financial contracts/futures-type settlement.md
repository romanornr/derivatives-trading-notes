***A futures type settlement*** is one in which a buyer pays no money upfront
but instead agrees to pay the seller an agreed-upon price at a later date.


***A futures settlement*** is one in which the buyer ***does not pay the seller in advance*** but agrees to pay the seller at a **later date** at an agreed-upon price.


#### [[margin deposit]]

The exchange receives a [[margin deposit]] from each participant, which it retains as collateral against the buyer or seller defaulting.

Margin requirements are determined by the exchange risk and the contract's value.

* => If the price of the [[commodity]] increases, the buyer receives the difference.  
* => If the price decreases, the seller receives the difference.  
* => At the conclusion of the contract, the buyer pays the selling the agreed-upon price, and both parties get their [[margin]] deposits back.


#### [[options]] 

In North America, **all options trading is settled like stock**, which means that **the buyer pays the full purchase price upfront.** 

However, on U.S. **futures options markets**, the **[[underlying]] contract** is **settled one way** (futures-type settlement), while the options are settled in a different way ([[stock-type settlement]]).

This can sometimes cause problems when a trader has bought or sold an option to hedge a futures position.

If the profits from the option position exactly offset the losses from the futures position, the profits from the option position, because the options are settled like stock, are unrealized.

But the losses from the futures position will require an immediate cash outlay to cover [[variation requirement]].


A [[futures-type settlement]] is different compared to a [[stock-type settlement]].
