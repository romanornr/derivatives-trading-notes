  
A "box" is a type of [[options]] contract that allows the trader to take a position on the [[underlying]] security without having to commit to a specific price or direction.

<br>

The trader essentially buys or sells the right to buy or sell the underlying security at a set price, and the trade is only considered complete when the security reaches that price.
