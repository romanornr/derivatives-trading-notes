### exercise and assignment 
<br>
The exercise price of [[options]] is the price at which the option may be exercised
-> while the [[strike price]] is the price at which the underlying contract is purchased or sold.  
<br>
A [[call option]] is a contract that gives the buyer the right to acquire a stock at a specific price within a specified period, known as the [[expiration date]]
<br>
A [[put option]] is a contract that offers the buyer the right to sell an asset at a predetermined price within a certain time frame, known as the [[expiration date]] 
<br>
An option may have a fixed or variable [[strike price]]
-> A [[call option]] with a set strike price usually is less expensive than a call option with a floating strike price
->while a [[put option]] with a fixed strike price expires sooner than a put option with a floating strike price.
<br>
If the [[strike price]] is fixed
-> a call option is less expensive than a [[put option]]
-> If the strike price is fixed, a put option is less expensive than a call option
-> but a call option with a floating strike price expires sooner than a put option with a set strike price. 
<br>
When an option is exercised
-> the seller of the option is assigned.
-> Depending on the option type, the seller will be forced to take a long or short position in the [[underlying]] contract at the option’s exercise price.


<p>When a contract is transacted on an exchange, the relationship between buyer and seller is broken, and the exchange becomes the counter party to all trades.</p>
<br>
Exercise a call		-> You choose to buy at the exercise price.
Are assigned on a call -> You are required to sell at the exercise price.
Exercise a put		->You choose to sell at the exercise price.
Are assigned on a put	->You are required to buy at the exercise price
<br>
<p>Buyers exercise</p>
<p>Sellers are assigned</p>

A trader who buys a crude oil October 90 [[call option]]
-> has chosen to buy one October crude oil futures contract at $90 per barrel.

A trader who has chosen to short sell 100 shares of GE stock at $30 a share.
-> When an option is used, all of the rights and responsibilities that came with the option are exercised, just like if the option had been let to expire.
-> In this case, the trader has chosen to short sell 100 shares of GE stock at $30 a share.

<p>When an option is used, all of the rights and responsibilities that came with the option are exercised</p>

Just like if the option had been allowed to run out of time.

A trader who wants to exercise an option
-> must send a notice of exercise to either the person who sold the option or the exchange where the option was bought.
-> When a valid exercise notice is sent, the option seller has been given the option.
-> People who sell options have to take a long or short position in the contract at the option's "exercise price," depending on what type of option it is.
<br>
When a trader exercises an option
-> the exchange has to pick someone to buy or sell the [[underlying]] contract at its exercise price.

<p>In what way does the exchange make this choice? The person who is given the option must be someone who has sold the option and has not closed out the position with an offsetting trade, so they can get the option.</p>

-> Further, the exchange's decision on who will be assigned is almost entirely based on chance, with no trader having a better or worse chance of being assigned than another.
<br>
<p>There are a lot of new traders who get mixed up about whether the exercise and assignment leads to a long or short position (selling the underlying contract).</p>

Depending on the [[[underlying]] contract, when an exchange-traded option
is exercised, it can settle into: 

1. The physical underlying
2. A [[futures contract]] position
3. Cash
