### Settlement into the Futures Position
<br>
Remember

When you exercise a [[call option]]
-> you acquire a long position in the [[underlying]] [[futures contract]].


When you exercise a [[put option]]
-> you acquire a short position in the underlying futures contract.<br>
When you exercise a call
-> the option "settles" into a futures position, and you must deposit the required margin.
<br>
You will also receive a variation credit
-> which is the difference between the current price of the underlying futures contract and the exercise price of the call.
<br>
When you exercise a put
-> the option settles into a futures position, and you must deposit the required margin.Â 
<br>
You will also have a variation debit, which is the difference between the current price of the underlying futures contract and the exercise price of the put.
