### expiration date 

You have until the expiry date whether to purchase or sell a [[call option]] or [[put option]]
	-> This is the "expiration date.
	-> After the option contract expires, it loses all of its rights and obligations.
<br>
If you want to buy or sell [[options]] on stocks or stocks that are part of a group
-> they usually expire at some point in the month
-> This is called the “expiration date.”
-> Most traders pay more attention to the last trading day, the last business day before an option’s expiration. This is when an option can be bought or sold on an exchange.
<br>
Most stock options expire on the third Friday of the month
-> This is also the last trading day for most of them
-> If you live in a country where Good Friday is a legal holiday, it can sometimes fall on the third Friday of April. When this happens, the last trading day is the day before the Thursday before that Thursday.
<br>
When stock options were introduced in the United States
-> The last day to trade in contracts expire is the 3rd Friday of each month.
<br>
Many derivative strategies include holding an offsetting stock position until expiration
-> at which point the stock position is liquidated
-> As a result stock exchanges discovered that
	_-> as the close of trading approached on expiration Friday
			-> they are confronted by massive orders to buy and sell shares.
			-> These large orders often have the effect of disrupting trading or distorting prices at expiration.
<br>
To solve these large order imbalances 
-> Certain derivatives exchanges collaborate with the stock exchanges that trade the [[underlying]] stocks to determine the expiry value of a derivatives contract based on the [[underlying]] stock's starting price rather than the closing price on the previous trading day.

-> This way, there were fewer large order imbalances at the end of the contract.
-> Many stock index contracts have an expiration time of around 11:45 a.m
-> If an option is for a single stock, it still has the traditional “PM” expiration date
	-> which means how much that stock goes up or down determines how much that option is worth when it expires.

<p>While stock options have a predetermined expiry date, futures options may have a different expiration date depending on the commodity or financial instrument to which they are connected.</p>
<p>-> Delivery at maturity for futures on physical items, such as agricultural or energy products, may take a few days which is why they are named futures. </p>
-> As a result, options on physical commodities futures sometimes expire many days or even weeks before the [[futures contract]] expires.
<br>
-> They often expire in the month before the futures month.
February is the last month in which an option on a March contract may be exercised. June is the last month in which an option on a July contract may be exercised.
