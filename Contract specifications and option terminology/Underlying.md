### Underlying 

When you buy or sell an option
-> you will buy or sell a certain type of stock or commodity.

This is called the “underlying asset.”
<br>
There may be a way to change the amount of the underlying when someone buys an option from a bank or other dealer.
<br>
People who buy and sell options on stocks usually buy and sell 100 shares of stock as the “underlying.”
<br>
If you own a [[Call option]] you can buy 100 shares
if you own a [[Put option]], you can sell 100 shares
<br>
If the option is purchased on an exchange, the exchange sets the underlying value.
<br>
If the price of an underlying stock is very low or very high
-> an exchange may change the number of shares in the underlying contract to make the contract size big enough to trade on the exchange.
<br>
If you buy futures options on any exchange
-> the underlying is always a futures contract.
<br>
If you own a call, you can buy one futures contract.
If you own a put, you can sell one futures contract.
<br>
As a general rule, the futures contract option that is based on 
-> is based on the futures contract that expires at that time.
<br>
If you buy an April futures option
-> it has an April futures contract as its base.
<br>
If you buy a November futures option
-> it has a November futures contract as its base. 
<br>
Because of this, an exchange may also offer serial options on futures
-> which are options that do not expire at the same time as a certain time in the futures.
<br>
You can not buy a futures option when there is not an exact match for its month.
-> The next month of a futures contract is used as its underlying when this happens.
<br>
If you want to trade in financial futures
-> for example, you can buy and sell them at certain times of the year.
March, June, September, and December futures are traded.
<br>
When you buy an option, the March option
-> is based on a March futures contract
-> The June option is based on a June futures contract.  
<br>
Some interest-rate futures markets can offer serial options.
<br>
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the London International Financial Futures Exchange, and the Eurodollars market
	-> all offer short-term options on the same long-term futures contract as long-term futures options on the same long-term futures contract.
