<b>Few things that they take into account when setting the margin requirements for options trades.</b>
<ul><li>How much risk there is in each position in order to figure out how much money they need to deposit in order to trade.</li><br>
<li>How likely it is that certain things could happen and then ask for a margin that would cover those risks</li><br>
<li>Use risk management tools like Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk (SPAN).</li></ul>
