### The strike price

The strike price or [[exercise]] price
-> is the price at which the holder of the [[options]] can buy the [[underlying]] or sell the option.

<p>If the option is exercised</p>
* -> Holder of a [[call option]] will pay the exercise price.
* -> Holder of a [[put option]] will receive the exercise price.<br>

The [[exercise price]] for options on an exchange are set by the exchange.
* -> at equal intervals, bracketing the [[underlying]] contract's current price. 
<br>
<p>Option exchanges also offer different types of exercise prices</p>
* -> such as at-the-money
* -> out-of-the-money,
* -> and dollar-based exercise prices<br>

As the price of the [[underlying]] contract changes, the exchange may offer additional strike prices.
<br>
If the [[underlying]] price rises to 70<br>
* *-> the exchange may add 80, 85 and 90 exercise prices to the list of prices.
* => In addition, if the exchange thinks it will help more people trade, it can set intermediate strike prices like 52½, 57½, 62½, 67½.
