### Options
<br>
Every option market brings traders and investors with varying expectations and objectives together.
<br>
-> Some traders approach the market having a preconceived notion about the direction in which prices will go.
<br>
-> Certain investors aim to utilize options to hedge against unfavorable price fluctuation.
<br>
-> Some individuals seek to profit from pricing differentials between comparable or related items.
<br>
-> Some operate as intermediaries
			-> buying and selling on behalf of other market players in the hope of profiting from the spread between the bid and ask prices.
<br>
While expectations and objectives vary
	-> every trader's education should involve an awareness of option contract specifications and a command of the language used in the options markets.
<br>
Without a firm grasp of the terms of an option contract, as well as the associated rights and obligations
	-> a trader cannot expect to make the most use of options, nor will he be prepared for the very real dangers associated with trading.
<br>
Without proficiency in the options language
	-> a trader will be unable to indicate his willingness to purchase or sell in the market.
<br>
