### in the money, at the money and out of the money

[[options]] contracts 

<ul>
<li>"in the money" -> positive intrinsic value,</li>
<li>"out of the money" -> negative intrinsic value. </li>
<li>"at the money" -> has no intrinsic value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Options are considered to be “in the money”, “at the money”, or “out of the money”</p><br>
<p>Depending on the relationship between the [[exercise price]] of an option and the price of the <a href="#underlying???? ">underlying contract.</a>
</p>
<ul>An option with positive intrinsic value is said to be "in the money"
<li>by the amount of intrinsic value.</li></ul><br>

<ul>
With a stock trading at $44, a $40 [[call option]]
<li>is $4 in the money </li></ul><br>

<ul>
A $55 put option contract with a stock trading at $44
<li>is $11 “in the money”. </li></ul><br>
<ul>
"Out of the money"
<li>refers to an option that has no intrinsic value</li>
<li>and is priced only of time value. </li></ul><br>

<p>A call option must have an exercise price lower than the current price of the underlying contract to be “in the money.” </p>

<ul>
if the put option is in the money
<li>a call option with the same exercise price</li>
<li>must be "out of the money."</li></ul><br>

<p>It is important to remember that</p>
<ul>
if a call option is “in the money”

<li>-> a put option with the same exercise price and underlying contract</li>
<li>-> must be “out of the money”</li>
</ul><br>
<ul>
With the stock trading at $44
<li>-> the put option is $4 “out of the money,”</li>
<li>-> the $55 call option is $11 out of the money.</li>
</ul><br>
<ul>
an option is said to be "at the money"
<li>if the exercise price is equal to the current price of the underlying contract.</li>
<li>Technically, such an option is equally unprofitable since it has no intrinsic value.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Traders distinguish between “at-the-money” and “out-of-the-money” options because, as we will see, “at-the-money” options have very specific and desirable characteristics. Such options tend to be most actively traded. 

To be more specific, an option’s exercise price must be equal to the current price of the underlying contract.</p>
