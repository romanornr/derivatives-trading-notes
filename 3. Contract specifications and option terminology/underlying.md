### Underlying 

When you buy or sell an option
* -> you will buy or sell a certain type of stock or commodity.

This is called the “underlying asset.”
<br>
There may be a way to change the amount of the underlying when someone buys an option from a bank or other dealer.
<br>
People who buy and sell [[options]] on stocks usually buy and sell 100 shares of stock as the “underlying.”
<br>
* If you own a [[call option]] you can buy 100 shares.
* if you own a [[put option]], you can sell 100 shares.
<br>
If the option is purchased on an exchange, the exchange sets the underlying value.
<br>
If the price of an underlying stock is very low or very high.
* -> an exchange may change the number of shares in the [[underlying]] contract to make the contract size big enough to trade on the exchange.
<br>
If you buy futures [[options]] on any exchange.
* -> the underlying is always a [[futures contract]].
<br>
If you own a [[call option]], you can buy one [[futures contract]].
If you own a [[put option]], you can sell one [[futures contract]].
<br>
As a general rule, the [[futures contract]] option that is based on 
* -> is based on the futures contract that expires at that time.
<br>
If you buy an April futures option
* -> it has an April [[futures contract]] as its base.
<br>
* If you buy a November futures option
-> it has a November [[futures contract]] as its base. 
<br>
Because of this, an exchange may also offer serial [[options]] on [[futures contract]]
* -> which are [[options]] that do not expire at the same time as a certain time in the futures.
<br>
You can not buy a futures option when there is not an exact match for its month.
* *-> The next month of a futures contract is used as its underlying when this happens.
<br>
If you want to trade a financial [[futures contract]].
* -> for example, you can buy and sell them at certain times of the year.
March, June, September, and December futures are traded.
<br>
 When you buy an option, the March option.
* -> is based on a March futures contract.
* -> The June option is based on a June [[futures contract]].  
<br>
Some interest-rate futures markets can offer serial [[options]].
<br>
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the London International Financial Futures Exchange, and the Eurodollars market
	* -> all offer short-term [[options]] on the same long-term futures contract as long-term futures options on the same long-term [[futures contract]].
<br>
They may also list long-term futures
* -> There might be a March [[futures contract]] that expires in two years that could be underlying for a March [[options]] contract that expires in two years. 
<br>
Mid curve [[options]].
* -> are short-term options on long-term [[futures contract]] that can be bought and sold. 
<br>
The [[options]] can be one-year mid curves, two-year mid curves, or five-year mid curves.
* -> It could also be the [[underlying]] for a March option that expires in a year. 
<br>
They are short-term options on [[futures contract]] with at least two years to go
* -> (a short-term option on a [[futures contract]] with at least five years to [[maturity]]).
