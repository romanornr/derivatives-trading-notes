An **option premium** is the **current market price** of an **option contract**.  


* => It is also the amount that the seller of the option receives from the buyer.

When an [[call option]] or [[put option]] is acquired, the **buyer pays the seller a premium**.
* => Even if the option is not [[exercised]], the premium is non-refundable.
