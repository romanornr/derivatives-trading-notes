### Parity Graphs<br><br>
<p>An option's intrinsic value is its value if it is exercised immediately.</p>

<p>The intrinsic value of an option is its greatest potential result. The extrinsic value of an option is its worst-case scenario. </p>
<p>When you plot the value of an option position at expiry, you are plotting its intrinsic value.</p><p>Option buyers have a low risk and unlimited profit potential, while option sellers have a low profit potential and unlimited risk.</p><br>
<ul>  
intrinsic value represents a credit or positive value for someone who has bought an option
<li>The buyer of the option will buy low and sell high.</li></ul><br>
<ul>intrinsic value represents a debit or negative value for someone who has sold an option.
<li>The option seller will be forced to buy high and sell low.</li>
</ul><br>

This graph of the value of a long [[call option]], position at [[expiration date]] as a function of the price of the [[underlying]] contract.<br>

Below the [[exercise price]], the option has no value.<br>
Above the [[exercise price]], the option gains one point in value for each point increase in the underlying price.<br>
<p>long call</p>

<br>
<ul>
The next graph shows the value of a short call position at expiration.<p>
<li>-> If the  option is in the money, the value of the position is negative.</li>
<li>-> For every point the underlying rises above the exercise price</li>
<li>-> The position loses one point in value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Short call</p>

<br>
<p>we can create the same type of expiration graphs for long and short put  
positions</p>
<p>long put</p>

<p>short put</p>

<p>A parity graph represents the value of an option position at expiration, parity being another name for intrinsic value.</p>
<p>Because of their shapes, traders sometimes refer to the four basic parity graphs (long and short call and long and short put) as the hockey-stick diagrams.</p>

<ul>
<p>The four basic parity graphs highlight one of the most important characteristics of options trading.</p>
<li>-> Buyers of options have limited risk (they can never lose more than the option's price) and unlimited profit potential.</li><br>
<li>Sellers of options have limited profit potential (they can never make more than the option's price) and unlimited risk.</li></ul><br>
<p>Given the unbalanced risk-reward trade-off</p>

<ul>
<p>new option traders end to have the same reaction: why would anyone do anything other than buy options?</p>

<li>-> purchase of an option</li>
<li>-> results in a position with limited risk and unlimited profit</li>
<li>->Seems more desirable than the limited profit & unlimited risk that result from selling</li>
<li>-> Yet, some traders are willing to sell options in every options market.</li>
</ul><br>

<p>Why are they willing to do this in the face of this unbalanced risk-reward trade-off?</p>

<ul><p>The answer has to do with the best and worst that can happen and the likelihood of those occurrences.</p>

<li>-> Someone who sells an option is exposed to unlimited risk</li>
<li>-> If the amount received for the option is great enough & perceived risk is low enough</li>
<li>-> a trader might be willing to take that risk. Probability plays in option pricing.</li></ul>
