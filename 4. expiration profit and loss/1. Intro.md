### Expiration profit and loss

Options traders must often deal with a bewildering assortment of contracts. With several expiration months, with multiple [[exercise price]] available in each month.

<p>with both calls and puts at each exercise price, it can be difficult to decide which contracts represent profit opportunities.</p><br>
<p>An options trader might ask a very obvious question: what is an option worth?</p>
<p>There is no one easy answer to this question, because option prices can be affected by many different market forces. </p>

<ul>
<p>However, there is one time in an option’s life when everyone can agree on its value.</p>
<li>At expiration, an option is worth exactly its intrinsic value: zero if it is “out of the money”</li>
<li>or the difference between the underlying price and the exercise price if it is “in the money”. </li>
</ul><br>
For the 95 call option
-> If the [[underlying]] price at expiration is 95 or below<br>
-> the call is “out of the money” and therefore worthless.<br>
<ul>
If the underlying price rises above 95
<li>-> the 95 call option will go “into the money"</li>
<li>-> gaining one point in value for each point that the underlying price rises above 95.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
For the 110 put option
<li>if the underlying price is 110 or above</li>
<li>the put is “out of the money” and therefore worthless.</li>
</ul><br>

But if the underlying price falls below 110, the 110 put goes into the money, gaining one point in value for each point decline in the underlying price.<br>
