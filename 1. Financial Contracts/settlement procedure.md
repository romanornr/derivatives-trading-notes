### Settlement procedure
<br>
What actually happens when a contract is traded on an exchange?
<p>The settlement procedure</p>
*-> <b>Facilitates</b> the <b>transfer of the money and ownership of a contract.</b>
* -> This is <b>determined</b> by the <b>regulations</b> of the exchange and the <b>type of contracts</b> traded.
<p>Consider a trader buying 100 shares of a $50 stock</p>
<p>Total value of the stock: 100 x $50 = $5000</p>
* -> The buyer must pay this amount to the seller.
* -> The exchange acts as an intermediary and transfers it to the seller.
* -> Simultaneously, the <b>exchange takes delivery</b> of the <b>shares from the seller</b>.
* -> and <b>transfers</b> these <b>to the buyers.</b>
<br>

This is basically a [[cash transaction]] with the <b>exchange making both delivery and payment</b>.
