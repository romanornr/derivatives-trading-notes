### Settlement procedure
<br>
What actually happens when a contract is traded on an exchange?  


The settlement procedure
* -> **Facilitates** the **transfer of the money and ownership of a contract**.  

* -> This is **determined**  by the **regulations** of the exchange and the <b>type of contracts</b> traded.

Consider a trader buying 100 shares of a $50 stock.  


Total value of the stock: 100 x $50 = $5000.  


* -> The buyer must pay this amount to the seller.  

* -> The exchange acts as an intermediary and transfers it to the seller.  

* -> Simultaneously, the **exchange takes [[delivery]]** of the <b>shares from the seller</b>.  

* -> and <b>transfers</b> these <b>to the buyers.</b>  


<br>

This is basically a [[cash transaction]] with the <b>exchange making both delivery and payment</b>.
