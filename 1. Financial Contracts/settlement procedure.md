### Settlement procedure
<br>
What actually happens when a contract is traded on an exchange?  


The settlement procedure
* -> **Facilitates** the **transfer of the money and ownership of a contract**.  

* -> This is **determined**  by the **regulations** of the exchange and the <b>type of contracts</b> traded.

<br>

#### [[cash transaction  ]]

Consider a trader 
``buying 100 shares of a $50 stock``


Total value of the stock: ``100 x $50 = $5000``.


* -> The buyer must pay this amount to the seller.  

* -> The exchange acts as an intermediary and transfers it to the seller.  

* -> Simultaneously, the **exchange takes [[delivery]]** of the <b>shares from the seller</b>.  

* -> and <b>transfers</b> these <b>to the buyers.</b>  

<br>

This is basically a [[cash transaction]] with the **exchange making both [[delivery]] and payment**.

An **exchange** is a marketplace where assets are bought and sold. **The transaction is considered a [[cash transaction]]** since the buyer and seller agree on the price.  

<br>

### futures type settlement 

A **futures contract is a forward contract**
* -> there is no immediate exchange of money for goods.  

* ->The buyer pays no money, and the seller receives none.   

* -> By entering into a [[forward contract]], both the buyer and the seller have taken on future [[obligation]]

<br>

At contract [[maturity]]
* -> the seller is has the [[obligation]] to deliver ([[delivery]])

* -> and the buyer has the [[obligation]] to pay.  
 <br> <br>
 
 
 To do this, the exchange collects a [[margin deposit]] from each party that it holds as security against possible default by the buyer or seller.  

* -> It depends on the [[notional value]] of the contract and the possibility of price fluctuations over the life of the [[futures contract]].  

* -> An exchange will try to set margin requirements high enough so that the exchange is reasonably protected against default but not so high that it inhibits trading.  

<br>

If the price of the [[commodity]] at [[maturity]] is $90, the buyer must pay $90 Ã—1,000 = $90,000.

* -> A futures trader can close out a position in one of two ways.
* -> Before the [[maturity]] of the [[futures contract]], he can make an offsetting trade, selling out the futures position and buying it back in the same [[delivery]] month.  
* -> Or, on or near the [[maturity]] date, he can take [[delivery]] of the [[commodity]].


If the position moves against the trader, he may be forced to close the position earlier than intended.

* -> [[margin]] is money collected by the exchange to ensure that a trader can fulfill future financial obligations should the market move against him.

* -> Even though deposited with the exchange, margin deposits still belong to the trader and earn interest for the trader.

<br>

 [[variation credit or debit]] results from fluctuations in the price of a futures contract. A [[variation payment]] can either make interest if the variation results in a [[credit]]. If the result is in a [[debit]] it will lose interest.  

<br>

When a trader buys a [[futures contract]], he is said to have a long position, and when he sells a [[futures contract]], he is said to have a short position.  



If the price of the futures contract falls
* -> the long position loses money, and the short position makes money. 

If the price of the futures contract rises
* -> the long position makes money, and the short position loses money.

<br>

All exchange-traded options in North America, whether stock options, stock indexes, futures, or foreign currencies, are [[stock-type settlement]].  


* -> In stock option markets, this is both logical and consistent because both the underlying contract and options on that contract are settled using identical procedures.

* -> However, on U.S. futures options markets, the [[underlying]] contract is settled one way ([[futures-type settlement]]), while the options are settled differently ([[stock-type settlement]]).

<br>

If a trader is unaware of the different settlement procedures.  

* -> He can occasionally find himself with unexpected [[cash flow]] problems.

* ->This can cause problems when a trader has bought/sold an option to hedge a futures position.  

* Even if the profits from the option position exactly offset the losses from the futures position
	* -->  the profits from the option position are unrealized because the options are settled like stock.

	* -> But the losses from the futures position will require an immediate cash outlay to cover [[variation requirement]].

-The settlement situation on most exchanges outside North America has been simplified by making option and underlying settlement procedures identical. 
-In this text, when presenting option examples, we will generally assume the settlement convention used in North America, where all options are subject to stock-type settlement. 
-If the underlying is subject to stock-type settlement, then the options on the underlying are subject to stock-type settlement. If the underlying is subject to futures-type settlement, the options are subject to futures-type settlement. 
-Under this method, a trader is unlikely to have a surprise variation requirement on a position that he thinks is well hedged.
