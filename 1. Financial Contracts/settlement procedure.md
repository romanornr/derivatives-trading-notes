### Settlement procedure
<br>
<p>What actually happens when a contract is traded on an exchange?</p>

<ul>
<p>The settlement procedure</p>
<li><p>-> <b>Facilitates</b> the <b>transfer of the money and ownership of a contract.</b></p></li>
<li><p>-> This is <b>determined</b> by the <b>regulations</b> of the exchange and the <b>type of contracts</b> traded.</p></li>
</ul><br>
<p>Consider a trader buying 100 shares of a $50 stock</p>
<ul>
<p>Total value of the stock: 100 x $50 = $5000</p>
<li><p>The buyer must pay this amount to the seller.</p></li>
<li><p>The exchange acts as an intermediary and transfers it to the seller.</p></li>
<li><p>Simultaneously, the <b>exchange takes delivery</b> of the <b>shares from the seller</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>and <b>transfers</b> these <b>to the buyers.</b></p></li>
</ul><br>

This is basically a [[cash transaction]] with the <b>exchange making both delivery and payment</b>
