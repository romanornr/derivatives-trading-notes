Anyone who enters a contract to buy or sell wants to be sure that the other person will do what he says he will do.  

A **buyer** wants to be **sure** that the **seller will do [[delivery]].**  
* -> a **seller** wants to **be sure** that the **buyer will pay** for the assets.

<br>

People will not want to trade in a market if there is a real chance that the other person will not pay.

<br>

For an exchange-traded agreement to be safe, the exchanges take care of both [[delivery]] and payment.

<br>

An exchange breaks the link between the buyer and seller right away when a deal is made. Instead, two new links are made. The buyer from each seller is now the exchange. If the buyer does not pay, the exchange will. Also, each person who buys something from the exchange is now a seller. If the seller does not show up for work, the exchange will make sure it gets there on time.

<br>

One way for an exchange to protect itself from possible default is to set up a clearinghouse.

<br>

The [[clearinghouse]] may be a part of the exchange or a completely separate business. It is in charge of processing and ensuring that all trades made on the exchange go through smoothly and are safe.

<br>

The clearinghouse is in charge of making sure that all contracts that are traded on an exchange are legitimate.


Exchanges serve a vital role in ensuring that buyers and sellers may trade with confidence.

<br>

### [[clearinghouse]]

<br>

A [[clearinghouse]] is either a branch of the exchange or an independent business
* -> that is in charge of processing and insuring all deals executed on the exchange.

Member clearing firms are clearing firms that are affiliated with the exchange and handle deals made by individual traders.  


If a trader fails, a clearing business will ensure that his or her commitments are met.
* -> The clearinghouse collects [[margin]] from traders and deposits it with the clearinghouse.


In **certain situations**, the clearinghouse may allow a clearing business to aggregate the positions of all traders at the firm.

Because some traders would have long holdings while others will have short positions in the same contract, the clearinghouse may minimize the [[margin deposit]] needed from the clearing business.
