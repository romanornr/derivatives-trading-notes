A debit is when the buyer of a [[futures contract]] is **charged money** from the exchange.  


* This happens when the **price of the [[futures contract]] goes down**.  

* The buyer is **charged the difference** between the **current price** and the price at which the contract was bought.

A debit is the opposite of a [[credit]].
