A credit is when the buyer of a [[futures contract]] is credited with money from the exchange.  

* -> This happens when the **price of the [[futures contract]] goes up.** 

* => The buyer is credited with the **difference** between the **current price** and the **price at which the contract was bought.**

A credit is the opposite of a [[debit]]
