A **stock-type settlement** is a **[[cash transaction]]** where **both parties agree** on the **conditions** and then **exchange money for assets**.


If the stock that was originally purchased at $50 per share rises to $60.
* -> The buyer will have a mental record of a $1,000 profit.  

This profit, however, is <b>unrealized</b>, and the buyer is <b>unable to spend it</b>.  

* If the buyer wants to spend the $1,000
* He <b>must sell</b> his 100 shares to someone else at a price of $60 per share.

### [[options]] [[settlement procedure]]

**Options must be paid for immediately and in full**
* -> all profits or losses are unrealized until the position is closed.
* -> In stock option markets, the [[underlying]] contract and [[options]] on that contract are settled using identical procedures.
