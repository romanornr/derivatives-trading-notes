#### stock-type settlement 
<br>
is a method of trading stocks in which <b>profits and losses</b> are <b>only realized</b> when the <b>position is closed.</b></p><br>
If the stock that was originally purchased at $50 per share rises to $60.
* -> The buyer will have a mental record of a $1,000 profit.
<br>
This profit, however, is <b>unrealized</b>, and the buyer is <b>unable to spend it</b>.<br><br>If the buyer wants to spend the $1,000, he <b>must sell</b> his 100 shares to someone else at a price of $60 per share.</p>
