### margin deposit 

is an amount of money that is paid to an exchange  
to ensure that the buyer and seller of a [[futures contract]] will live up to their [[obligation]].

<br>
The exchange collects a [[margin]] deposit.  

* -> From each party that it holds as security against possible default by the buyer or seller.  

* -> The amount of margin is commensurate with the risk to the exchange  

* -> also depends on the notional value of the contract  

* -> as well as the possibility of price fluctuations over the life of the [[futures contract]].  

* -> An exchange will try to set margin requirements high enough  

* -> so that the exchange is reasonably protected against default  

* -> but not so high that it inhibits trading.

<br>

Consider a [[futures contract]] 
* that calls for the [[delivery]] of 1,000 units of a [[commodity]] at a unit price of $75.

* The contract's notional value is $75,000.  

* If the exchange has set the margin requirement for the contract at $3,000.  

* Buyer and seller must instantly deposit $3,000 with the exchange when the contract is transacted.

<br>


What happens if the commodity's price later climbs to $80?

* The buyer now has a profit of $5,000.  

* while the seller has a loss of the same amount.  

* As a consequence, $5,000 will be transferred from the seller's account to the buyer's account. 
 
 * As long as the position is active
 
 * -> the daily variation credit or debit is caused by movements in the price of the futures contract.

Margin and variation settlement refers to [[futures-type settlement]] in which an initial margin deposit is followed by daily [[cash transaction]]
