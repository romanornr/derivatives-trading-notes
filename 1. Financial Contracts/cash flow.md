cash flow is the **movement** of **money** in and out of an **account**.  

When you trade [[futures contract]] or [[options]], you are entering into a contract that will have future cash flows.  

<br>

The exchange wants to be sure that both parties to the contract will be able to fulfill their [[obligation]], so it requires a [[margin deposit]] from each party. The [[margin deposit]] is held by the exchange as security against possible default.

<br>

The exchange also requires a daily [[variation payment]] from each party. This payment results from fluctuations in the price of the contract and is made as long as the position remains open.

If you trade futures, you must have the cash to cover the margin requirements for the trade.

But you also need to have the cash to cover any [[variation payments]] that may be required. If you don't have the cash to cover the variation, you may be forced to close the position earlier than you intended.
