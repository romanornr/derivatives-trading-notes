A commodity is a **physical asset** that can be bought and sold.  

* such as agricultural products, metals, oil, or energy products.  

<br>

Commodities are the [[underlying]] assets for [[futures contract]] and [[options]] contracts.  

<br>

When someone trades a [[futures contract]].  
* -> they are agreeing to buy or sell a commodity at a set price at some point in the future.  

When someone trades an options contract
* they are agreeing to buy or sell a commodity at a set price at some point in the future.  


* This is why commodities are so closely linked to futures and [[options]] trading
* because the contracts are based on the prices of these [[underlying]] assets.  

<br>

#### [[maturity]]

During [[maturity]] of the commodity.  

 
* The seller must make [[delivery]]  

* The buyer must pay an amount equal to the current value of the commodity.  

* After [[delivery]] and payment have been made, the [[margin deposit]] will be returned to the respective parties

<br>

During [[expiration date]].  

* The seller of the futures must [[delivery]] the [[underlying]] commodity to the buyer on the expiration date of the contract.

* The buyer must then pay for the commodity in full.  

* If the position is closed through an offsetting purchase or sale

* a final [[variation payment]] is made, and [[margin deposit]] is returned to the trader.  

* If the position is carried to [[maturity]]

* the final variation payment is based on the underlying index price at [[maturity]].  

* and the margin deposits are returned to the parties final [[variation payment]].  

*  This is a payment that results from fluctuations in the price of the futures contract as long as the position remains open.  

* The [[futures-type settlement]], where there is an initial [[margin deposit]] followed by daily [[cash transaction]], is also known as [[margin and variation settlement]]

* The [[settlement procedure]] of a contract happens when an agreement is made between the buyer and seller of the contract.  

* When a contract is traded on an exchange  

* ->the [[settlement procedure]] is determined by the regulations of the exchange and the type of contracts traded.
