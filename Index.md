1. [[settlement procedure]]<br>
2. in progress [[dividend]]<br>
3. [[options]] terminology<br>

<b>The human brain is non-linear</b>:
we constantly hop from concept to concept. Your second brain should function similarly.<br>

Making and following **connections** is simple with Obsidian. Take a seat and wonder at the knowledge graph.<br><br>

<b>The graph</b> summarizes our knowledge. Investigate, observe, and maintain motivation. With grouping, filtering, and presentation settings, you may customize your view.
The local graph illustrates the relationships in your immediate vicinity.<br><br>

<b>Convergence of your concepts through back-links.</b>
