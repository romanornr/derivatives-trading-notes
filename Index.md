### Options & Derivatives Trading


<b>Note taking still in progress</b>

<p>I write these notes for myself but decided to publish them by using Obsidian</p>

Obsidian is a powerful **knowledge base** on top of a **local folder** of plain text Markdown files.<br>
<br>
1. Financial Contracts
* [[settlement procedure]]  
* [[market Integrity]]

2. Forward pricing 
* [[forward price]]
* [[dividend]]

3. [[options]] terminology  
4. [[expiration profit and loss]]

<br>

#### Everything is connected<br>

<b>The human brain is non-linear</b>:
we constantly hop from concept to concept. Your second brain should function similarly.

<br>

Making and following **connections** is simple with Obsidian. Take a seat and wonder at the knowledge graph.

<br>

<b>The graph</b> summarizes our knowledge. Investigate, observe, and maintain motivation. With grouping, filtering, and presentation settings, you may customize your view.
The local graph illustrates the relationships in your immediate vicinity.<br><br>
