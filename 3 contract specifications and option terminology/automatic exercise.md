### automatic exercise

Automatic exercise is a procedure whereby the [[options]] clearing corporation will [[exercise]] an option on behalf of the option holder if the option is [[in-the-money]] at [[expiration date]] and the holder has not instructed the clearing corporation not to exercise.

<ul>
<p>To prevent a scenario in which an in-the-money option expires unexercised</p>

<li>most exchanges have implemented an automatic exercise policy.</li>

<li>Even if an exercise notification is not submitted</li>
<li>the exchange will execute any “in-the-money” option on behalf of the option holder upon expiration.</li></ul><br>
<p>The criteria for automatic exercises may differ from one exchange to the next and depending on who owns the option.</p><br>
<ul>
<li>Exchanges may automatically execute those options “in-the-money” by a predefined amount</li>
<li>If the automatic exercise threshold is 0.05</li>
<li>-> an option must be at least 0.05 for the exchange to exercise the option. </li></ul><br>

<ul>
If the option is in the money by 0.03
<li>the trader may still exercise it but must send an exercise notice.</li>
<li>On the opposite side, if the option is in the money by 0.06</li>
<li>a trader who feels that the option is not worth exercising may submit a do not exercise notice.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the exchange will automatically exercise the option on the trader’s behalf.</li></ul><br>
<p>Because professional traders and retail clients have distinct cost structures, the exchange may establish a separate automatic exercise threshold for each side.</p>

<p>The threshold maybe 0.05 for a retail trader but only 0.02 for an institutional trader.
An exchange would normally establish the criteria required for each group to identify who is a professional trader and who is not.</p>
