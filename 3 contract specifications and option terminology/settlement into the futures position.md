### Settlement into the Futures Position
<br>
Remember

When you exercise a [[call option]]
-> you acquire a long position in the [[underlying]] [[futures contract]].


When you exercise a [[put option]]
-> you acquire a short position in the underlying futures contract.<br>
When you exercise a call
-> the option "settles" into a futures position, and you must deposit the required margin. ([[margin deposit]])
<br>
You will also receive a [[variation credit]] (see [[variation credit or debit]])
* -> which is the difference between the current price of the [[underlying]] [[futures contract]] and the exercise price of the call.
<br>
When you exercise a put
-> the option settles into a futures position, and you must deposit the required [[margin]]. 
<br>
You will also have a [[variation debit]], which is the difference between the current price of the [[underlying]] [[futures contract]] and the [[exercise]] price of the [[put option]]

<br>

An [[underlying]] [[futures contract]] is currently trading at 85.00 with a point
value of $1,000. [[margin]] requirements are $3,000 per contract.
