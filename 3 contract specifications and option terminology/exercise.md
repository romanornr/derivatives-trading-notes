Exercising an option means that you are choosing to buy or sell the [[underlying]] asset at the [[strike price]] of the option.

The main reason to exercise an option is if the current market price of the [[underlying]] security is higher than the strike price. This way, you can buy the security at the lower strike price and then sell the security immediately at the higher market price, making a profit.

<br>
  
Other reasons to exercise an option include if the option is about to expire and you don't want to lose the money you've invested in it, or if you need the cash and selling the security is the best way to get it.

<br>

If the current market price of the [[underlying]] security is higher than the [[strike price]]
-> it generally makes sense to exercise a [[call option]]

If the current market price of the [[underlying]] security is lower than the [[strike price]]
-> it generally makes sense to exercise a [[put option]].

### other factors 

<br>

However, there are other factors that can come into play when making the decision to exercise an option. These include:


* The time value remaining in the option contract:
-> All else being equal, options with more time until expiration will be more expensive than those with less time remaining. Therefore, it may not make sense to exercise an option if there is still significant time value remaining.


* The size of the [[premium]]
-> The bigger the[[premium]], the more expensive it will be to exercise the option. Again, all else being equal, it may not make sense to exercise an option if the [[premium]] is relatively high.


* Implied volatility
-> This measures how much the market expects prices to move in the future and can have a big impact on options prices. If implied volatility is low, options will be cheaper and it may make sense to exercise them even if the current market price is unfavorable. If implied volatility is high, options will be more expensive and it may not make sense to exercise them even if the current market price is favorable.


* [[dividend]]
-> If the [[underlying]] security pays dividends, holders of a [[call option]] may want to exercise early in order to receive the [[dividend]].
[[Put option]] holders may want to exercise early in order to avoid having to pay the [[dividend]].

Bottom line: There is no single answer as to whether or not it makes sense to exercise an option. It depends on a number of factors, including the [[strike price]], current market price, time value remaining, implied volatility, and [[dividend]].

### Hedging 

<br>

If you are hedging with [[options]], exercising an option can have different effects depending on the type of option and how it is being used in the hedge.

Generally speaking, when you exercise an option, you will want to close out the opposite position in order to avoid creating or increasing a risk exposure.

If you are long a [[call option]] and short the [[underlying]] security, you will want to close out the short position in the underlying security when you exercise the [[call option]]. Otherwise, you would be left long the [[underlying]] security without offsetting protection.

The same would be true if you were short a [[put option]] and long the [[underlying]] security.
In this case, you would want to close out the long position in the [[underlying]] security when you exercise the [[put option]].

There are, however, some cases where exercising an option can be beneficial from a hedging perspective. 

If you are long a [[call option]] and short the [[underlying]] security, you may want to exercise the [[call option]] and take [[delivery]] of the [[underlying]] shares if the market price of the [[underlying]] shares is close to the [[strike price]]. This would allow you to lock in a profits by selling the shares at the market price and avoid any potential losses if the market price were to fall below the strike price before [[expiration date]].

Similarly, if you are short a [[put option]] and long the [[underlying]] security, you may want to exercise the [[put option]] and sell the [[underlying]] shares if the market price of the shares is close to the [[strike price]].

This would allow you to lock in a profits by selling the shares at the [[strike price]] and avoid any potential losses if the market price were to rise above the [[strike price]] before [[expiration date]]
