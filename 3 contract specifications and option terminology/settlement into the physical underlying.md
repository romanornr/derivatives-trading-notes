### Settlement into the Physical Underlying

When an option settles into the physical underlying
-> the individual who exercised the option pays the exercise price and gets [[underlying]] in exchange.
<br>
For example, if you exercise a [[call option]], you must pay the exercise price and get underlying in exchange.
<br>
When you exercise a [[put option]]
-> you get the exercise price and must produce the underlying.
<br>
This is vital to understand because when you exercise an [[options]]
->you are really swapping the option for the [[underlying]].
<br>
So, if you executed a [[call option]]
-> you would pay the [[exercise price]] and get the [[underlying]]
<br>
If you executed a [[put option]]
-> You would get the [[exercise price]] and be required to provide the [[underlying]].
