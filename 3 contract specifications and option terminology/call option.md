  
A call option gives the buyer the right, but not the [[obligation]], to buy asset at a predetermined price ([[strike price]]) at an [[expiration date]] in the future. 

Investors often use options to hedge against adverse price movements in the [underlying](underlying) asset.

### [[premium]]

When buying a call option, the investor pays the option [[premium]] to the seller. The option [[premium]] is the price of the call option. The [[strike price]] is the price at which the [[underlying]] asset can be bought or sold if the option is [[exercised]]. The [[expiration date]] is the date on which the call option expires and becomes worthless if it has not been [[exercised]].


If the underlying asset's price is above the [[strike price]] at expiration, the option will be in the money and the buyer will [[exercise]] the option, buying the asset at the [[strike price]]. If the [[underlying]] asset's price is below the [[strike price]] at expiration, the option will be out of the money and expires worthless.


The option buyer may lose the entire [[premium]] paid for the option if the [[underlying]] asset's price doesn't move in the desired direction before [[expiration date]]

However, the loss is limited to the [[premium]] paid for the option, while a stock investor who doesn't use options to hedge can theoretically lose unlimited amounts of money if the stock price falls sharply.

### Delta

<br>

 Delta measures the change in the price of a call option in response to a 1 point change in the [[underlying]] asset's price.
 
 If the [[underlying]] asset is a stock, then 1 point is equal to $1. and call option has a delta of 0.50.
 Then its price will rise by $0.50 if the stock price increases by $1. Conversely, if the stock price falls by $1, the call option's price will fall by $0.50.

 Delta can also be expressed as a percentage. For example, if a call option has a delta of 0.50, then it has a delta of 50%.

 Delta is important because it can help investors gauge the potential risk and reward of an options position. It can also be used to hedge against losses in the [[underlying]] asset.

 For example, if an investor is long 100 shares of XYZ stock and is worried about a potential decline in the stock price, they could buy 1 XYZ 100 strike call option to hedge their position. If the stock price falls by $1, the call option's delta will kick in and offset some of the loss from the falling stock price.

### [[settlement procedure]]

The settlement procedure for call options depends on whether the option is [[cash-settled]] or [[physically settled]]. 

With a [[cash-settled]] option, the option buyer does not receive or deliver the [[underlying]] asset when the option is exercised. Instead, the option buyer and seller simply settle their respective obligations by exchanging cash. The amount of cash exchanged is equal to the difference between the [[strike price]] and the [[underlying]] asset's price at expiration, multiplied by the number of shares represented by the option contract. 

For example, let's say XYZ stock is trading at $50 per share and you buy 1 XYZ 100 strike call option for $2 per share. At expiration, XYZ stock is trading at $55 per share. Since the option is [[cash-settled]], you would simply exchange $500 with the option seller ($5 x 100 shares). 

With a physically settled option, the option buyer receives or delivers the underlying asset when the option is exercised. For example, let's say you buy 1 XYZ 100 strike call option for $2 per share. At expiration, XYZ stock is trading at $55 per share and you exercise your option. Since the option is physically settled, you would receive 100 shares of XYZ stock from the option seller.

### Hedging 

<br>

Hedging is a risk management strategy that involves taking offsetting positions in 2 different investments in order to minimize the risk of loss from an adverse price movement in one of the investments.

For example, a stock investor who owns shares of ABC Company might purchase a [[call option]] on ABC Company stock as a way to protect against a decline in the stock price. If the stock price falls, the value of the investor's call option will increase and offset some of the loss from the falling stock price.

Call options can also be used to hedge against losses in a [[underlying]] asset that is held short.

If an investor believes the price of XYZ stock is going to fall, they could sell 100 shares of XYZ stock and buy 1 XYZ 100 strike call option.

If the price of XYZ stock falls as expected, the value of the call option will increase and offset some of the loss from the falling stock price.

However, if the price of XYZ stock rises instead of falling, the entire [[premium]] paid for the call option will be lost, plus any additional losses from the rising stock price.
