  
Dividend value is the value of the dividends paid on a stock during the life of a [[call option]].
The dividend reduces the value of the call, so the higher the dividend, the lower the value of the call.

#### How does the dividend value relate to the volatility value?

<br>

Dividend value is inversely related to [[volatility value]]. That is, the higher the dividend, the lower the volatility value, and vice versa.
