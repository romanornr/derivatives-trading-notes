### Slope


An option’s slope is the change in the position value with the respect to changes in the price of the [[underlying]].<br>
<ul>
If an option is “out the money”
<li>its value is unaffected by changes in the price of the underlying contract.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
If an option is “in the money”
<li>it will either gain or lose value as the underlying price changes.</li>
</ul><br>

<p>The total slope of a position consisting of multiple options can be calculated by adding up the slopes of the individual options.</p>

The slope of a long underlying position is always +1

The slope of a short underlying position is always -1
