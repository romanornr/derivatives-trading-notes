A **clearinghouse** is an **organization** that **makes sure all trades are processed and fulfilled** according to the terms of the contract.

It is made up of member clearing firms, which are businesses that process trades for individual traders.

If a trader defaults on their [[obligation]]
* -> the clearing firm will make sure the trade is fulfilled.

<br>

The **clearinghouse** may **allow** a clearing **firm to aggregate the positions** of all the traders at the firm
* which means that some traders will have long positions while other traders will have short positions in the same contract.
* -> The clearinghouse **may** also **reduce the [[margin deposit]] required** from the clearing firm.

#### important to understand 

When studying market integrity and clearinghouses, it is important to understand the **role that each entity plays** in **ensuring** the **integrity** of exchange-traded contracts.

It is also important to understand the process by which clearinghouses collect and distribute [[margin deposit]]

<br>

___

<br>

#### Explaining

The role of the clearinghouse is to **protect** the **exchange** against the **risk of default** by either the buyer or the seller. 

To do this, the clearinghouse will act as the buyer from each seller and the seller to each buyer.

If the buyer defaults
* -> the exchange will guarantee payment


If the seller defaults
* -> the exchange will guarantee [[delivery]]


In order to protect itself
* => the exchange will require all traders to become associated with a clearing firm.

<br>

The clearing firm will then be responsible for processing trades and guaranteeing any financial [[obligation]] that arise from those trades.

<br>

Should an individual trader default
* -> the clearing firm will be responsible for fulfilling that trader's [[obligation]]


To further protect itself, the clearinghouse will require clearing firms to [[margin deposit]].
* This [[margin]] is used as collateral in case of default by either the clearing firm or an individual trader.

<br>

In some cases, the clearinghouse may permit a clearing firm to aggregate the positions of all traders at the firm.

<br>

This means that the firm can group together all the long and short positions of its traders in the same contract. If the positions cancel each other out, the clearinghouse may reduce the amount of margin that the firm needs to deposit.
