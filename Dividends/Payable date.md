### Payable date 

Payable date -> The day a dividend is payable to qualified investors.

Often, the [[dividends]] amount may be approximated based on the companyâ€™s previous dividend payments.


If a corporation pays quarterly dividends (as is conventional in the United States)
	-> and has done so for the last 10 quarters at a rate of 25 cents
	-> it is fair to assume that the company will continue to pay 25 cents.


If the dividend payment date is projected to be near the maturity date of a futures contract
-> a minor error in the dividend computation
-> might significantly affect the derivatives value!
