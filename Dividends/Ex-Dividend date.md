### Ex-Dividend date

The first day a stock trades without [[dividend]] rights.

In the United States
	-> the final day to acquire a dividend-paying stock is 3 business days before the [[Record date]]  
	
2 business days before the [[record date]] is the ex-dividend date.

On the ex-dividend date
	-> quotations for the stock will reflect that it is trading ex-dividend
	-> all quotes will include the dividend amount reduced from the stock price.

If a stock closes at $67.50 the day before the ex-dividend date
 - opens at $68.25 the next day (the ex-dividend day)
* and the dividend is $0.40

the stock’s price will be
```$68.25 + 1.15 ex-div 0.40.```

If the stock had opened unchanged
	-> the price would have been $67.50 - $0.40 dividend
			-> or $67.10
	 
 At $68.25
	 -> the stock’s price increases by $1.15.
