# Dividends

A trader may be needed to examine derivative stock contracts and estimateÂ future dividend payments from a company.

Typically, a trader will need to predict the dividend amount and payment date.

Some terms:

[[Declared date]]: Company anounces -> amount + date of devidents paid

[[Record date]]: The deadline for acquiring shares in order to collect dividends

[[Settlement date]]: Settlement date: The day the stock is transferred to the purchaser.

[[Ex-Dividend Date]] (Ex-Date): The first day a stock trades without dividend rights
