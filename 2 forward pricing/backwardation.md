**Backwardation** occurs when the price of a [[commodity]] is greater than the price of a [[futures contract]].

This seems illogical because the [[interest rate]] and [[storage cost]] will always be positive. 


 How about considering a company that needs a [[commodity]] to keep its factory running? If the company cannot obtain the [[commodity]], it may have to take the very costly step of temporarily closing the factory. In the company's view, the cost of such drastic action may be prohibitive.
 
 To avoid this situation, the utmost important interested company may be willing to pay an inflated price to obtain the [[commodity]] right now. 
 
 If [[commodity]] supplies are tight, the price that the company may have to pay could result in a backward market . The spot price will be greater than the price of a [[futures contract]].
 
 The benefit of obtaining a [[commodity]] right now is sometimes referred to as a [[convenience yield]]. It can be challenging to assign an exact value to the [[convenience yield]]. however, if interest costs, [[storage cost]],and insurance costs are known, a trader can infer the [[convenience yield]] by observing the relationship between the spot price and futures price



Another factor that may contribute to [[backwardation]] is if producers of the [[commodity]] are hoarding supplies in anticipation of rising prices in the future. 

This could result in the spot price being greater than the price of a [[futures contract]] because **producers are hoping to sell their product at a higher price in the future.**

This type of [[backwardation]] is more common in markets where there is no central [[clearinghouse]], such as the market for crude oil.

#### risks 

<br>

Some of the risks associated with trading commodities in a [[backwardation]] market include:

1) The possibility of having to make physical [[delivery]] of the commodity. If the [[futures contract]] expires and the market is still in [[backwardation]], the trader may have to pay for [[storage cost]] and insurance costs while holding the [[commodity]].

2) The possibility of the market moving out of [[backwardation]] before the contract [[expiration date]]. If this happens, the trader will be stuck with a [[futures contract]] at a higher price than the spot price of the commodity.

3) The possibility of the market going into [[contango]] before the contract expires. This could lead to the trader having to sell the [[commodity]] at a lower price than the spot price.

4) The possibility of the market going into [[contango]] and staying there until the contract expires. If this happens, the trader will have to pay storage and insurance costs on the [[commodity]] while it is in storage.

### Option trading

Option traders will often refer to backwardation when discussing the implications of seasonality on [[options]] prices.

If a trader is considering buying an option that expires in December, they might be aware that the market is currently in backwardation.

This means that the December [[futures contract]] is trading lower than the spot price. As a result, the options trader might expect the option to be cheaper than if the market was in [[contango]].

This means for the options trader that there is more potential for the option to increase in value as expiration approaches. This is because the December [[futures contract[]] will need to increase in price for it to converge with the spot price.

If the market is in [[contango]], the [[futures contract]] will need to decrease in price for it to converge with the spot price. As a result, the options trader would expect the option to be more expensive if the market was in [[contango]].

### Hedging 

Hedgers often use [[commodity]] [[futures contract]] to protect themselves from price movements in the [[underlying]] [[commodity]].

If a hedger is long a [[commodity]], they might buy a [[futures contract]] to hedge their position.

If the market is in backwardation, the price of the futures contract will be lower than the spot price.

As a result, the hedger's position will be protected to the downside. If the market is in [[contango]], the price of the futures contract will be higher than the spot price. As a result, the hedger's position will be protected to the upside.

#### margin

When a trader buys a [[commodity]] [[futures contract]], they are required to post [[margin]]. Margin is the amount of money that is required to be deposited in order to open a position. The margin requirements for a [[futures contract]] are set by the exchange where the contract is traded.



If the market is in [[backwardation]], the [[margin]] requirements will be lower than if the market was in [[contango]].

This is because the price of the futures contract will be lower than the price of the underlying commodity. As a result, there is less risk involved in holding a position in a backwardation market. If the market is in [[contango]], the [[margin]] requirements will be higher than if the market was in backwardation. This is because the price of the [[futures contract]] will be higher than the price of the [[underlying]] [[commodity]]. As a result, there is more risk involved in holding a position in a [[contango]] market.

### variation payment

A [[variation payment]] is a payment made to a trader when the price of the [[underlying]] [[commodity]] moves in the trader's favor. The amount of the payment is based on the number of contracts held and the tick size of the contract.


**If the market is in [[backwardation]], the [[variation payment]] will be lower than if the market was in [[contango]].**

This is because the price of the futures contract will be lower than the price of the [[underlying]] [[commodity]].

As a result, the trader will not receive as much money for each tick that the price moves in their favor. If the market is in [[contango]], the [[variation payment]] will be higher than if the market was in [[backwardation]].

This is because the price of the [[futures contract]] will be higher than the price of the [[underlying]] [[commodity]]. As a result, the trader will receive more money for each tick that the price moves in their favor.
