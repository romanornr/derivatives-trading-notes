In a **contango** market, long-term futures contracts trade at a [[premium]] to short-term contracts.

This means that you would have to pay more for a contract that expires further in the future than one that expires sooner. 

This happens because there are usually costs associated with holding a [[commodity]] for a long period of time, like storage and insurance.

The implications of this are that if you want to buy a [[commodity]], you would want to do so through a short-term contract.

However, if you are a producer of the [[commodity]], you would want to lock in a higher price by selling through a long-term contract.

### [[futures contract]]

<br>

Futures contracts are generally more expensive when they are in contango compared to [[contango]] market. This is because the [[options]] that are further out in time tend to be more expensive than those that are closer to [[expiration date]].

The reason for this is that there is more time [[premium]] built into the price of the longer-term [[options]]. This can make it more difficult to make money by buying [[futures contract]], because you have to be right about both the direction of the move and the timing of the move.

### risks 

<br>

There are a few key risks associated with trading in a contango market:

1) The risk that the price of the [[commodity]] will fall and you will have to pay more for the long-term contract than you would have for the short-term contract.

2) The risk that the contango will widen (i.e. the difference between the short-term and long-term contract prices will increase) and you will have to pay even more for the long-term contract.

3) The risk that the market will move into [[backwardation]] (i.e. the long-term contract price will fall below the short-term contract price) and you will be stuck with a high-priced long-term contract.

4) The risk that the market will become more volatile and the prices of both short-term and long-term contracts will become more volatile.

5)  The risk that you will not be able to find a counterparty to take the other side of your trade. This is especially a problem in illiquid markets.

6)  The risk that the commodity you are trading does not have a well-established futures market. This increases the chances of the market being illiquid and/or having wide bid-ask spreads.

7)  The risk that the futures exchange on which the contract is traded will default on its [[obligation]]. This is a risk with all futures contracts, but it is worth mentioning here as well.

8)  The risk that you will not be able to meet your [[margin]] requirements and will be forced to liquidate your position at a loss.

### [[options]]


The impact of contango or [[backwardation]] on [[options]] trading is two-fold.

First, the price of the [[underlying]] asset affects the price of the option. If the [[underlying]] asset is in contango, the price of the option will be higher than if it were in [[backwardation]].

Second, the time decay of the option will be affected. If the underlying asset is in contango, the time decay will be accelerated, meaning the option will lose value at a faster rate.


When options are in contango, it generally costs more to buy an option than sell it.

This is because the [[options]] that are further out in time tend to be more expensive than those that are closer to [[expiration date]].

The reason for this is that there is more time [[premium]] built into the price of the longer-term options. This can make it more difficult to make money by buying options, because you have to be right about both the direction of the move and the timing of the move.


<br>

___

### Hedging 

Hedging is a way to protect yourself from price movements in the [[underlying]] asset. When you hedge, you are essentially buying an insurance policy against price movements. If the price of the [[underlying]] asset goes up, you will make money on your hedge, and if the price goes down, you will lose money on your hedge.

The impact of contango or [[backwardation]] on hedging is that it affects the cost of the hedge. If the underlying asset is in contango, the cost of the hedge will be higher than if it were in [[backwardation]]. This is because the [[options]] that are further out in time tend to be more expensive than those that are closer to expiration. ([[expiration date]])

Hedging in a contango market can be more difficult and expensive than hedging in a [[backwardation]] market. This is because you have to buy more expensive [[options]] to protect yourself from a price increase in the [[underlying]] asset.


<br>

___

<br>

### [[margin]]


The impact of contango or [[backwardation]] on [[margin]] is that it affects the amount of money you have to put up to buy or sell a futures contract. If the [[underlying]] asset is in contango, the [[margin]] requirements will be higher than if it were in [[backwardation]].

This is because the [[options]] that are further out in time tend to be more expensive than those that are closer to expiration.

Margin requirements in a contango market can be higher than in a [[backwardation]] market. This is because [[futures contract]] that are further out in time tend to be more expensive than those that are closer to [[expiration date]].


<br>

___


### [[variation payment]]

<br>

The impact of contango or [[backwardation]] on [[variation payment]] is that it affects the amount of money you have to put up to cover the daily price movements of the [[underlying]] asset. If the [[underlying]] asset is in contango, the variation margin requirements will be higher than if it were in [[backwardation]]

This is because the options that are further out in time tend to be more expensive than those that are closer to expiration.

Variation margin requirements in a contango market can be higher than in a [[backwardation]] market. This is because the [[futures contract]] that are further out in time tend to be more expensive than those that are closer to [[expiration date]].


<br>

___

<br>

### [[interest rate]]


In general, higher interest rates are associated with higher future prices, and thus, a market in contango. This is because when interest rates are high, it costs more to carry a [[commodity]] forward into the future.

The relationship between interest rates and contango is not always linear, however. There are other factors that can affect the price of a [[commodity]] in the future, such as demand and supply.
