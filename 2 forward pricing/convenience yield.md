The **convenience yield** is the **benefit received** from **holding an asset** rather than selling it immediately. 


The convenience yield is the **benefit of holding a [[commodity]] in inventory**.
This benefit is due to the fact that the holder of the commodity can choose when to sell it, and can therefore take advantage of favorable market conditions. The convenience yield is always positive, but it may be offset by storage costs, insurance costs, and other costs associated with holding the commodity.

### [[forward price]]

When calculating the fair price of a [[forward contract]], the convenience yield should be taken into account. The convenience yield is usually small relative to other factors, such as the interest rate, but it can be significant in some cases.

For example, the convenience yield on crude oil is often estimated to be 3-5 percent In order to calculate the fair price of a forward contract, one must take into account the convenience yield. The convenience yield is the benefit of holding a commodity in inventory.

This benefit is due to the fact that the holder of the commodity can choose when to sell it, and can therefore take advantage of favorable market conditions. The convenience yield is always positive, but it may be offset by storage costs, insurance costs, and other costs associated with holding the commodity. When calculating the fair price of a forward contract, the convenience yield should be taken into account.

The [[forward price]] of a [[commodity]] is the price at which the commodity can be purchased or sold at a later date, and is determined by the spot price, the convenience yield, the cost of carry, and the interest rate.

This **yield** is **often positive** for a [[commodity]] like oil, because **people are willing to pay a [[premium]]** for the right **to purchase oil at a later date**.

* -> The **convenience yield** should be taken into account when **calculating** the **fair price** for a **[[forward contract]]**

####  key points

<br>

There are a few key points to remember when studying convenience yield:

1. Convenience yield is the **extra return** that an **investor earns** from **holding a physical [[commodity]]** rather than a financial instrument ([[futures contract]]) that tracks the price of the [[commodity]].

2. The **size** of the convenience yield is **determined** by the **cost of storing** and **transporting** the [[commodity]].

3. Commodities with a **high convenience yield** are typically **more volatile** than those with a low convenience yield.

4. The convenience yield of a commodity can **change over time** as the **cost of storage** and **transportation changes**.

5. Investors can **hedge** against the **risk of a change** in convenience yield by **buying or selling** [[futures contract]]
