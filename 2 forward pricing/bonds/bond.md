### Types

There are several types of bonds, including:

- [[treasury bond]]: These are issued by the federal government and are considered the safest type of bond because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government.

- [[municipal bonds]]: These are issued by state and local governments and are typically exempt from federal taxes.

- [[corporate bonds]]: These are issued by businesses and are subject to credit risk, meaning that the issuer may not be able to make interest payments or repay the principal.

- [[mortgage-backed securities]]: These are bonds that are backed by a pool of mortgages.
