Interest rates are the **costs of borrowing money**.  


The interest rate is the **percentage of the loan amount** that a **lender charges for borrowing** money. 

<br>

If you take out a loan for $100 at an interest rate of 10%
* -> you will have to pay back the loan plus interest which will be a total of $110.

### interest rate environment 

  
The interest rate is a **significant factor** in **determining the prices of financial assets**. For example, bonds are priced based on the interest rate environment.

When interest rates are low, [[bond]] prices are high, and when interest rates are high, bond prices are low. This is because when interest rates are low, the income from a bonds is relatively high, and when interest rates are high, the income from bonds is relatively low.

The interest rate is also a significant factor in the price of a stock. When interest rates are high, the cost of capital is high, and when interest rates are low, the cost of capital is low. This is because when interest rates are high, the cost of borrowing money is high, and when interest rates are low, the cost of borrowing money is low.

The interest rate is also a significant factor in the price of a house. When interest rates are high, the cost of borrowing money to buy a house is high, and when interest rates are low, the cost of borrowing money to buy a house is low.

When considering an investment, it is important to think about the interest rate environment. For example, if you are considering buying a [[bond]], you should think about whether interest rates are going to rise or fall in the future. If interest rates are going to rise, the price of the bond is likely to fall, and if interest rates are going to fall, the price of the bond is likely to rise.

<br>

The interest rate is a crucial component in influencing the pricing of financial assets.
For example, a [[bond]] is valued dependent on the interest rate environment.

When **interest rates** are **low** &darr;
* -> **[[bond]] prices** are **high** &uarr;
 
<br>

When **interest rates** are **high** &uarr;
* -> **[[bond]] prices** are **low**. &darr;

<br>

This is because when **interest rates are low** &darr;
* -> **[[bond]] income** is **comparatively high**. &uarr;

<br>


When **interest rates** are **high** &uarr;
* -> **[[bond]] income** is **relatively low** &darr;

##### The interest rate is also a key effect on the price of a stock.

<br>

The interest rate is also a significant factor in the price of a stock. When interest rates are high, the cost of capital is high, and when interest rates are low, the cost of capital is low. This is because when interest rates are high, the cost of borrowing money is high, and when interest rates are low, the cost of borrowing money is low.  

The price of a stock is the present value of all future [[cash flow]] from the stock. The interest rate is important because it is used to discount these future cash flows.  

If a stock is expected to pay a [[dividend]] of $1.00 per share next year, and the interest rate is 10%, the present value of this [[dividend]] would be $0.91. 

This is because the interest rate is used to discount the future [[cash flow]]. The interest rate is also used to discount the future earnings of a stock.

If a stock is expected to earn $2.00 per share next year, and the interest rate is 10%, the present value of this earnings would be $1.82.

The interest rate is important because it affects the present value of all future cash flows from a stock. A higher interest rate will discount these cash flows more, and a lower interest rate will discount these cash flows less.


<br>

When **interest rates** are **high** &uarr;
* -> the **cost of capital** is **high** &uarr;  

<br>

 
when **interest rates** are **low** &darr; 
* -> the **cost of capital** is **low.** &darr; 

<br>

This is because when **interest rates are high** &uarr;
* -> the **cost of borrowing** money is **high** &uarr;

<br>

But when **interest rates are low** &darr;
* -> the **cost of borrowing** money is **low**. &darr;

<br>

___

<br>

### The interest rate is also a key element in the cost of a home

  
In order to **buy a house**, you will need to **take out a mortgage**. The interest rate on your mortgage will **affect** the **cost of your monthly payments**, as well as the **total amount of interest** you will pay over the life of the loan.

Higher interest rates will increase your monthly payments and the total amount of interest you will pay, while lower interest rates will decrease your monthly payments and the total amount of interest you will pay.

<br>

* When **interest rates are high**, the **cost of borrowing** money to **purchase a property** is **high**

* But when **interest rates are low**, the **cost of borrowing** money to **buy  a house is low**.

<br>

When choosing an investment, it is critical to evaluate the interest rate situation.

<br>

For example, if you are **contemplating purchasing a [[bond]]**
You should **examine** whether interest **rates will climb or decline** in the future.

<br>

If **interest rates increase** &uarr;
* -> the **bond's price will likely decrease** &darr;


If interest rates fall &darr;
* -> the **bond's price will likely climb**. &uarr;

<br>

___

<br>

### Interest rate in [[forward contract]]

<br>

The interest rate is also a significant factor in determining the prices of a [[forward contract]].
The [[forward price]] of a contract is **based** on the **interest rates** of the **two currencies** involved in the **transaction**.

When one currency has a higher interest rate than the other, the currency with the higher interest rate will be more expensive to borrow, and the forward price of the currency will be higher.

<br>

**Forward contracts** are usually **priced using the interest rates** of the **two currencies** involved in the transaction.

<br>

If you are buying a [[forward contract]] on Japanese Yen
* -> The price will be quoted in terms of U.S. Dollars per 100 Yen.

<br>

Suppose that the interest rate in Japan is 0.5%

The interest rate in the United States is 2.5%

* The [[forward price]] of Yen in terms of U.S. Dollars will be lower than the current spot price  
* -> because it costs more to borrow Dollars than Yen.
* -> This means that the Yen will be cheaper to buy in the future than it is today.
