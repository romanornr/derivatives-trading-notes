A **dividend yield** measures how much a company pays out in [[dividend]] each year **relative** to its **share price**.

If a company has a share price of $100 and pays out $5 in dividends each year, then its dividend yield is 5%.

#### metric 
<br>

Dividend yield can be a useful metric for investors who are looking for companies that have a history of paying out regular dividends. However, it is important to remember that dividend yield can fluctuate over time, so it is not necessarily a predictor of future dividend payments.


When evaluating a dividend yield, it can be helpful to compare it to the average dividend yield of companies in the same industry.

This can give you a sense of whether the company's dividend yield is high or low relative to its peers. It is also important to remember that dividend yield is just one factor to consider when making investment decisions. Other factors, such as a company's financial stability and dividend growth history, should also be taken into account.

#### [[forward contract]]

<br>

When you are trying to price a [[forward contract]], you need to know the current dividend yield as well as the expected dividend yield at the expiration of the contract. 

The current dividend yield can be found by simply looking at the current stock price and the most recent dividend per share. 

The expected dividend yield is a bit more complicated, as it involves estimating future dividends. Many factors, such as a company's financial stability and past dividend growth, can affect dividend payments in the future. As such, estimating future dividend yields can be difficult. 

However, there are a few methods that analysts use to try to forecast future dividend payments. These methods include the Gordon Growth Model and the Dividend Discount Model.

#### [[futures contract]]

<br>

Dividend yield can be an important factor in pricing a [[futures contract]]. This is because the dividend yield is used to calculate the cost of carry for the [[underlying]] asset.

The cost of carry is the expense associated with holding the underlying asset until the expiration of the contract.

This expense includes things like interest on the [[margin]] account and [[storage cost]].
If a stock has a [[dividend]] yield of 5% and the cost of carry for the stock is 2%, then the total cost of carry for the contract would be 7%.

#### [[options]]


  
Dividend yield can have an impact on the price of an [[options]] contract in two ways.

First, the dividend yield can affect the [[underlying]] stock price. This is because a higher dividend yield generally results in a higher stock price.

Second, the **dividend yield can affect the time value of an options contract**.

This is because the cost of carry for the underlying asset is typically higher for assets with high dividend yields. As such, **the time value of an option will generally be higher for an asset with a high dividend yield**.

#### Hedging 


When a company is hedging its exposure to the price of a particular security, it is often interested in the dividend yield of that security. This is because the **dividend yield can affect the price of the security**. 

If a stock has a high dividend yield, it may be more attractive to investors and therefore trade at a higher price.

Conversely, if a stock has a low dividend yield, it may be less attractive to investors and therefore trade at a lower price. By taking into account the dividend yield of a security, a company can better assess the potential impact of changes in the price of that security on its overall hedging strategy.
