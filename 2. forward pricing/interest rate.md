Interest rates are the **costs of borrowing money**.  


The interest rate is the **percentage of the loan amount** that a **lender charges for borrowing** money. 

<br>

If you take out a loan for $100 at an interest rate of 10%
* -> you will have to pay back the loan plus interest which will be a total of $110.

### interest rate environment 
The interest rate is a crucial component in influencing the pricing of financial assets.
For example, a [[bond]] is valued dependent on the interest rate environment.

When **interest rates** are **low** &darr;
* -> **[[bond]] prices** are **high** &uarr;
 
<br>

When **interest rates** are **high** &uarr;
* -> **[[bond]] prices** are **low**. &darr;

<br>

This is because when **interest rates are low** &darr;
* -> **[[bond]] income** is **comparatively high**. &uarr;

<br>


When **interest rates** are **high** &uarr;
* -> **[[bond]] income** is **relatively low** &darr;

<br>

<br>

##### The interest rate is also a key effect on the price of a stock.

<br>

When **interest rates** are **high** &uarr;
* -> the **cost of capital** is **high** &uarr;  

<br>

 
when **interest rates** are **low** &darr; 
* -> the **cost of capital** is **low.** &darr; 

<br>

This is because when **interest rates are high** &uarr;
* -> the **cost of borrowing** money is **high** &uarr;

<br>

But when **interest rates are low** &darr;
* -> the **cost of borrowing** money is **low**. &darr;

<br>

**The interest rate is also a key element in the cost of a home. **


* When **interest rates are high**, the **cost of borrowing** money to **purchase a property** is **high**

* But when **interest rates are low**, the **cost of borrowing** money to **buy  a house is low**.

<br>

When choosing an investment, it is critical to evaluate the interest rate situation.

<br>

For example, if you are **contemplating purchasing a [[bond]]**
You should **examine** whether interest **rates will climb or decline** in the future.

<br>

If **interest rates increase** &uarr;
* -> the **bond's price will likely decrease** &darr;


If interest rates fall &darr;
* -> the **bond's price will likely climb**. &uarr;

<br>

### Interest rate in [[forward contract]]

<br>

The interest rate is important because it **affects the price of a [[forward contract]]**.

The [[forward price]] is the price of a good or service that is to be delivered at some time in the future.

The [[forward price]] is agreed upon today, but the actual [[delivery]] (and payment) takes place at a future date.

<br>

The interest rate is important because it **affects the price of a forward contract**.

<br>

**Forward contracts** are usually **priced using the interest rates** of the **two currencies** involved in the transaction.

<br>

If you are buying a [[forward contract]] on Japanese Yen
* -> The price will be quoted in terms of U.S. Dollars per 100 Yen.

<br>

Suppose that the interest rate in Japan is 0.5%

The interest rate in the United States is 2.5%

* The [[forward price]] of Yen in terms of U.S. Dollars will be lower than the current spot price  
* -> because it costs more to borrow Dollars than Yen.
* -> This means that the Yen will be cheaper to buy in the future than it is today.
