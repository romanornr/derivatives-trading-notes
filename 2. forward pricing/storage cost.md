**Storage costs** are often defined as the **interest** that **might be received** if the **money used** to fund the **purchase** of the [[underlying]] [[commodity]] was instead put in a bank.

<br>

When a **[[forward contract]]** is **used to hedge** the future **acquisition or [[delivery]]** of a **physical [[commodity]]** (e.g., wheat, oil, etc. )

* the **storage costs** associated with the [[commodity]] are **referred** to as **carrying charges**. 
* -> The main idea is that **if** the **money used** to finance the **purchase of the [[commodity]] were instead deposited in a bank**
* -> The **interest earned** on the **deposit** would **cover the cost of storing the commodity.** This **opportunity cost is a type of storage cost**.

<br>

In general, the **higher** the commodity's **predicted future price**, the **greater the estimated storage expenses** and **hence** the **higher** the **forward price**.

<br>

As an example, imagine the price of maize is $3.00 per bushel at the moment
* -> and is predicted to increase to $3.50 per bushel in three months.
* -> Storage expenses are anticipated to be $0.05 per bushel during a three-month period (or 5 cents per bushel per month).
* -> Corn would cost $3.50 per bushel if it were sold ahead.

#### [[forward contract]]

**Forward contracts** are used to **hedge or speculate** on a commodity's **future price**.
The **[[forward price]]** of a [[commodity]] **is the futures price** at which it will be traded.

* The **primary difference** between the **forward and spot** prices is.
* -> the **[[forward price]]** takes into account **storage expenses**.
* -> whilst the **spot price does not**. 



Assume you are a farmer with three months till the corn harvest.
You are concerned about corn prices falling between now and then.
* -> You decide to **execute** a **forward contract** to **sell** your **corn** in **3 months** at a **price of $3.50** per bushel.
* -> This **implies** you have fixed a **selling price** and will **not** have to **worry about** it **declining** in **price**.

<br>

If the price of corn does not decrease to $3.50 per bushel within three months
* -> you will have sold your maize for less than it is worth.
* -> This is because the price of maize includes storage expenses, whereas your forward price does not.

<br>

* -> If the price of corn falls to $3.40 a bushel
* -> you will have sold your corn for more than it is now worth, but less than it would have been worth without the storage costs.
* -> In this situation, you have hedged your price risk by locking in a price that is greater than the current spot price.

### [[options]] usage

To **avoid** the previous example, yes you can either execute a **[[forward contract]]** with a higher **[[forward price]]**, or **purchase** a **[[put option]]** as a hedge

* -> A [[put option]] is gives the holder **the right**, but **not the [[obligation]]**, to **sell an [[underlying]]** asset **at** a specified price **([[strike price]])** **on or before** a specified date **([[expiration date]])**.

<br>

**Option contracts** are another **approach to protect against price fluctuations**. An option contract gives you the **right, but not the responsibility**, to **purchase or sell** a [[commodity]] at a predetermined price within a given time period.  

<br>

If you are a farmer who is concerned about corn prices decreasing, you may purchase a [[put option]]. This grants you **the right to sell corn** at a **certain price** **within** a **predetermined time period**. Though the price of corn goes below the [[strike price]] of the option, you **may [[exercise]]** your **option  and sell your corn at the higher price**, even if the market price is lower. This enables you to **lock** a **minimum price** for your corn.

<br>

Option contracts, like a [[forward contract]], may be used to speculate on a commodity's future price. You might **purchase a [[call option]]** if you **believe the price of corn will rise**. This grants you the **right to purchase corn at a certain price and within a predetermined time period**.

<br>

**Though** the **price of corn rises above** the **[[strike price]]** of the option, you **may [[exercise]]** your **option and purchase corn at the cheaper price**, even if the market price is higher.
This enables you to **lock a maximum price** for your corn.
