####  key points
There are a few key points to remember when studying convenience yield:

1. Convenience yield is the **extra return** that an **investor earns** from **holding a physical [[commodity]]** rather than a financial instrument ([[futures contract]]) that tracks the price of the [[commodity]].

2. The **size** of the convenience yield is **determined** by the **cost of storing** and **transporting** the [[commodity]].

3. Commodities with a **high convenience yield** are typically **more volatile** than those with a low convenience yield.

4. The convenience yield of a commodity can **change over time** as the **cost of storage** and **transportation changes**.

5. Investors can **hedge** against the **risk of a change** in convenience yield by **buying or selling** [[futures contract]]
