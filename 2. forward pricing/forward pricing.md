In general, the **fair price** for a [[forward contract]] 
is the **current cash price** + **the costs of buying now** - **the benefits of buying now**.
-> However, this can vary depending on the particular situation.


``the current cash price + the costs of buying now - minus the benefits of buying now.``

Let's say you have a friend who wants to buy a piece of land to build a restaurant on.

He's considering either buying it now or buying it in a year through a [[forward contract]].
* -> if he buys it now, he'll have to pay the asking price of $100,000.  

<br>

But if he buys it through a [[forward contract]]
* -> he'll have to pay the costs of buying now, which include the interest on the cash price, the real estate taxes, and the interest on the taxes.



He also knows that if he buys it now
* -> he'll get $6,000 worth of oil revenue from a small oil well on the land
* -> plus interest on that revenue

So, the fair forward price for the land should be $100,000
-> plus the costs of buying now
-> minus the benefits of buying now
* -> In this case would be $6,220.

### main factors for the fair forward price

There are 4 main factors to consider when calculating the fair forward price of a contract:

1. The interest rate: This is the cost of borrowing or lending money.

2. The storage costs: This is the cost of storing the underlying commodity.

3. The convenience yield: This is the benefit of having the commodity now rather than later.

4. The dividend yield: This is the benefit of receiving dividends from the underlying asset.

<br>

In **most cases**, the **fair forward price** will be **lower** than the current **spot price**.
* *-> This is because the **costs of buying** now typically **outweigh the benefits**.
